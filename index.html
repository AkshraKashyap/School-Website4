                <p class="text-muted text-left">Books play an essential role in everyone’s life. It helps to expand our capabilities, to know more about things that interest us. A library is a place that solves this problem. Great books on various themes, genres, and subjects can be found in only one place. The books that we need can be borrowed, and when we are done reading it, we return them for someone else to take it home.

                    School Library is the place where kids are introduced to the magical world of books. Where they can read and know about anything, they want to know. It is common for school students to write essays on the topic of the School Library. We have provided such articles that the student can refer to.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">School playgrounds are in a unique position to meet kids where they are, helping them become smarter, healthier and stronger through play. Studies show that outdoor physical activity not only benefits a child’s health but improves classroom performance, increases cognitive development and hones social skills.

                    For nearly 50 years, we’ve been at the forefront of innovation and research to design optimal school playgrounds that inspire and create our next generation of leaders. Schools play a critical role in helping ensure children are getting adequate outdoor physical activity through recess or outdoor classroom time where kids can play and learn on age- and developmentally appropriate playgrounds. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that children get 60 minutes of physical activity a day.</p>

                    School canteens, commonly referred to as cafeterias in the United States, provide a range of food options from complete, nutritionally-balanced meals to a' la carte choices. Faced with an overwhelming array of choices, and with little nutrition knowledge to guide them, middle and high-school students often struggle making wise lunch choices.
